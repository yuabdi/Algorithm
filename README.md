Optimizing Northeastern’s RedEye Shuttle Routes Using Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms

**Course:** CS5800 – Algorithms  
**Team Members:** Jiaqian Xu, Jiaxi Wen, Yusuf Abdi, Basil Coughlan  
**Institution:** Northeastern University  
**Semester:** Summer 2022


Project Overview

This project explores how Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms can be applied to optimize the **RedEye shuttle service** routes around the Northeastern University campus and the broader Boston area. The primary objectives are to:

- Minimize **fuel costs**
- Reduce **travel time**
- Improve **student safety** and **transportation reliability**

With rising fuel prices and students juggling responsibilities like classes and Co-op interviews, optimizing the shuttle system is both **economically** and **logistically** important.

Algorithms Used

We implemented and compared the following MST algorithms:

- **Kruskal's Algorithm**
- **Prim's Algorithm**
